I also know Spanish which as been very helpful throughout my life. This webpage will include facts about me and my contact information.

<p>I like many things in this world. Videogames, movies, sports, anime etc. When I grow up I either want to be a movie director or a software developer. My hobbies and likes have affected my thoughts on my career. I also like to hangout with friends and family.</p>
	
<h3>Dislikes</h3>

<p>I do not dislike many things. I don't like politics because they are too complicated. I also hate spiders and everything related to them, except spiderman, he's cool. I don't like Donald Trump either. I think we would be better off with someone else. </p>
