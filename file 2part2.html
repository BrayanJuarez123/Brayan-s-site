 <h1> About me </h1>

 	<h2> Video Games </h2>

 	<p> Videogames have had a huge impact on my life. When I was 8, I got my first console for Christmas, it was an xbox 360. It was very fun and definitely helped me whenever I was bored. I used that xbox until last Christmas, when I got a ps4. I have played the ps4 for 100s of hours with my friends. I still use and have been new games ever since I first aquired the console. Dozens of new games are coming out this year, and I will buy many of them. My favorite games are Call of Duty and Dark Souls. </p>

 	<h3> Movies </h3>

 	<p> Movies have also made a huge impact on my life. As I said before, I want to be a movie director when I grow up. My favorite movie is Godzilla 2014. I like action and horror movies so if I ever get the chance, I will most likely watch one. I like the Friday th 13th movies very much and they are definitely my favorite slasher movies, even though they aren't scary. I would do a top 5 list but there are too many movies that I like. </p>

 	<h4> Anime </h4>

 <p> Anime is in my opinion, the best type of tv to watch. If you don't know what it is, it is essentially cartoons for an older audience. My favorite animes are Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, and Akame Ga Kill. There are some "kid-friendly anime like Pokemon and Yugioh. But they aren't nearly as cool as the other animes.</p>
